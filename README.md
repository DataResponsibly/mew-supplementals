Supplemental materials for the paper of [Most-Expected-Winner](https://doi.org/10.1145/3588702).

## 1. Technical report

Please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00082) for the additional proofs, experiments, and the solver for RSM voting profiles.

## 2. Experiment code

Steps to repeat all the experiments:

- Install Anaconda or Miniconda.
- `conda env create -f environment.yml` to prepare for an independent Python environment with required packages.
- Execute `run_experiments.sh`
- Each experiment has its own folder in `./experiments/real/` or `./experiments/synthetic/`. The figures in the paper are generated by the `plot.ipynb` in each experiment folder.
